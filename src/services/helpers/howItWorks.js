    question: 'If Seniorly is free for searchers, how does it make money?',

      We are compensated by the community you eventually select.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you evaluate which communities to add to your website?',
    answer: `With over 40,000 senior housing properties of all sizes throughout the country, vetting each one can admittedly
      be a daunting task. However, we have a powerful, proprietary algorithm that ranks each community based on several
      criteria we know you care about; user ratings, inspection reports, pricing, photos, and more. Therefore, the properties
      that appear first in your search results are there because they rank higher in quality, not because we have promotional
      partnerships with them.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you evaluate which local referral agents to add to your website?',
    answer: `We interview each local senior living referral agent, ensuring they are aware of our high standards for personal
      attention and care we require during your search process. Once your move is complete, we administer an anonymous feedback
      survey with you and the selected property to assess how well the agent adhered to our expectations. This ensures subsequent
      searcher’s enjoy only the best experience.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Who will you give access to my personal information?',
    answer: `We respect your privacy. Therefore, we commit to only sharing your information with the communities you select.
      In addition, we assign a local referral agent to your account to ensure your needs are being met. To provide that valuable
      support for you, the agents have access to your information. Our agreements with agents prevent them from sharing that
      with anyone else. Anyone in violation of this is removed from our system.`,
