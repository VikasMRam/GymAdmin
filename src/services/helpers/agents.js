He recalls that many life experiences did not prepare him when his mother fought their dementia. It taught him the values of honor, respect, dignity, and compassion. These moments helped drive him to help others who face similar challenges. \n\nJim also knows that sons and husbands often become reluctant caregivers, and need support to weather the storm. Making the decision to place a loved one in someone else’s care can be eased with the hand of someone, like Jim, who knows the options for a successful change in lifestyle.  Jim Humphrey partnered with Seniorly in 2018.\n",

    "agentBio":"Daniel Sagal's grandmother fell, broke her hip, and spent three months in a local rehab center learning how to walk again in 2013. Living just down the street and being well aware of how difficult it was for his grandmother to go through such a traumatic experience, he joined her for Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy daily to help motivate her and translate the instructions provided by the Therapists. After three months, her walking ability was so-so at best and her Dementia had become a real issue. With a lack of activities, communication, or support, she felt stranded in her bed or wheelchair and had no desire to continue her life. When the time came to relocate her into a long term assisted living facility, there were few people willing to help and even fewer knowledgeable enough to provide useful information.\n\nDaniel formed a special bond with his grandma during this time and soon recognized that his support of her, and others in her situation, doesn't have to end when she completes her rehab. This personal experience sparked the concept of Total Senior and TotalSenior.com.\n\nAfter over half a decade of building a career in the Real Estate industry, Daniel changed gears and pursued something more meaningful. The days of working for money were over. There is a new goal in life: to help families find the best senior living options by providing the highest level and most compassionate service. As he strives to provide the best services available in the industry, he is building a brand that operates with integrity, strong morals, and loyalty. Daniel Sagal partnered with Seniorly in 2018.",

She considers it a privilege to be a part of your journey and to walk with you and your loved ones in navigating through making what is undoubtedly one of the most important decisions of your lives. \nWhat she love about Oasis Senior Advisors is the personal approach.

Is family capable of giving their time to assist? Is it safe for them to remain in their home or do they need to look at senior living options? Can they afford paying privately for caregiver services to come in to their home?\nThese questions, along with many others, led to the mission of The Right Move Senior Resource.

After college, Becky worked at a private club for 10 years as a membership manager and loved the relationships she built with the members. After her second child was born, it was an easy decision to stop working and enjoy her children. Around that time, Becky's grandparents moved to Florida. It was such a gift to spend quality time with them and help them in a caregiving role. This left her with such a love, appreciation for, and understanding of older adults.

She founded the company “Preparing for Care LLC” , using her hands-on experience and knowledge from caring for her 90-year old father to provide much needed education, support and guidance to adult children about to or now caring for their senior parents.\n\nHer goals are clear: to provide a resource for those needing to find reliable, vetted specialized services for their parents.

As he pursued college and a career, he followed my passion for elders by obtaining a master’s degree in aging and then, in serving the residents of retirement communities, assisted living and long-term care centers in three different states over the past 35 years. He was currently licensed as an Assisted Living Administrator and Nursing Home Administrator in the State of Florida.\n\nTom has come to believe that his purpose in life is simple – to love and serve others. In his work with Oasis Senior Advisors, he fulfills his purpose by being of service to you and your family during this time of transition. He learned about Oasis Senior Advisors while working as the executive director of a large assisted living center in Jacksonville, Florida. Through the eyes of the elders and their families who came to visit our community, he experienced the highest level of customer service provided by our local Oasis Senior Advisors. Time after time, our assisted living center was identified by Oasis as a perfect fit for both the elders’ healthcare needs and their lifestyle preferences. We were able to partner with Oasis and the elders/families to achieve a successful transition. He now looks forward to partnering with you and your family as an Oasis Senior Advisor.

    "agentBio":"Service in home health, adaptive transportation equipment, and a wide range of senior leadership roles has led Jim Ver Meer to an in-depth understanding of the importance of connecting aging adults to living space that complements their character.\n\nOne of the most satisfying activities for Jim has been mentoring and inspiring staff, and he uses those same skills and find that same satisfaction when learning about a senior's lifestyle, objectives, dreams, challenges, and plans. His 20 years up and down Colorado’s Front Range has also equipped him with a network of resources, including senior retirement options, but extending into many other areas to assist seniors.\n\nHe is also accustomed to getting on the floor of a van to assure a client’s wheelchair is safely secured or finding a solution to a health, financial, or logistical concern. It began with caring for his own family and would love to care for yours.\n\nIf you want to talk, even just once, Jim promises to share insights, propose ideas, and if you tell him 'that's it', he will leave you alone. But there just isn't any need to face this tough life transition without help. Jim Ver Meer partnered with Seniorly in 2018.",

    "agentBio":"Chris Gutierrez has called Southern California home his entire life. He, his wife, and two children reside in Pasadena, CA. With an undergraduate degree in Communication Arts from California State Polytechnic University in Pomona and a graduate degree from Pepperdine in Business Administration, Gutierrez’s goals were always to have his own company and care homes for the elderly. Raised by all 4 grandparents, the care homes are a way of giving back to our wonderful seniors in California. He is a California licensed Administrator for Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly.\nBringing experience from working for major corporations such as ConAgra, Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Turner Entertainment Networks, and the largest assisted living referral service, Gutierrez has taken those successful models and his education, to start Southern California Senior Resources in 2002. “I hope that my grandparents would be proud of the work that I have accomplished, and I sure wish that a company like Southern California Senior Resources would have been around when I placed my grandparents,” Gutierrez says.  Chris Gutierrez partnered with Seniorly in 2018.\n",
