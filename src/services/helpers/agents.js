      "agentBio":"Daniel Sagal's grandmother fell, broke her hip, and spent three months in a local rehab center learning how to walk again in 2013. Living just down the street and being well aware of how difficult it was for his grandmother to go through such a traumatic experience, he joined her for Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy daily to help motivate her and translate the instructions provided by the Therapists. After three months, her walking ability was so-so at best and her Dementia had become a real issue. With a lack of activities, communication, or support, she felt stranded in her bed or wheelchair and had no desire to continue her life. When the time came to relocate her into a long term assisted living facility, there were few people willing to help and even fewer knowledgeable enough to provide useful information.Daniel formed a special bond with his grandma during this time and soon recognized that his support of her, and others in her situation, doesn't have to end when she completes her rehab. This personal experience sparked the concept of Total Senior and TotalSenior.com.After over half a decade of building a career in the Real Estate industry, Daniel changed gears and pursued something more meaningful. The days of working for money were over. There is a new goal in life: to help families find the best senior living options by providing the highest level and most compassionate service. As he strives to provide the best services available in the industry, he is building a brand that operates with integrity, strong morals, and loyalty. Daniel Sagal partnered with Seniorly in 2018.",

      "agentBio":"Michelle Withrow has worked many years as a social worker, but it wasn't until she joined The Right Move Senior Resource that she recognized her dream to serve seniors was finally coming to fruition. Michelle has had numerous opportunities to serve others throughout her adult life.  Through her church, she were given the opportunity to serve as a missionary family at an orphanage in northeast Brazil for a period of two years.  Michelle's husband built a second orphanage, her twin daughters had the opportunity to serve children with unconditional love, and she worked with the staff to improve systems and conditions. After returning stateside, she was fortunate enough to serve fellow social workers by creating Social Work meetings with great speakers and resources in several Atlanta hospitals to increase the knowledge of community resources. Nowadays, Michelle's efforts have turned to serving her local church and community. For many years, it has been her dream to serve others by offering no cost social work to seniors and their families.  Michelle's past experiences have given her the opportunity to learn about useful, necessary resources to help aid the aging community and now she has daily opportunities to share her knowledge and heart with families. Her position has given her the ability to pray for (or with, if desired) families while supporting them through challenging decisions.  She is honored to walk alongside families during the trying times of finding a senior living community or in finding services to support them in the aging process. Michelle Withrow partnered with Seniorly in 2018. ",

But it wasn't until she'd gone through this personal experience that she knew what she wanted to do. She decided to become a Senior Care Authority Advisor to help other families avoid what she and her family went through.With a background in customer retention, customer service, and sales, Brandy is well suited to helping seniors and families find the right fit for their personality and needs. Brandy Randolph partnered with Seniorly in 2017.The Denver native spends much of her time visiting and reviewing the area's senior facilities — including assisted living, independent living, memory care, and residential care homes — to help her clients make the best possible decision for their loved ones. She meets one-on-one with families to assess their needs, schedules and accompanies them on visits to top-rated facilities, assists with negotiations and paperwork, and follows up with families after a placement is made.When not striving to make a difference in seniors' lives, Brandy enjoys spending time with her family — traveling, hiking, camping, boating, and seeking adventure of all kinds with her husband and two beautiful children.

Communication, compassion, and understanding are all part of the skill sets she has mastered working in the health care environment.  She didn't realize her passion for helping others until her late husband was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2016.  Pattie was unexpectedly thrust into a world where she had no experience and decisions needed to be made quickly, decisions that she did not feel equipped to make. Pattie had to become a caregiver, advisor, and advocate for the strongest person she had ever known.  She decided to partner with The Right Move Senior Resource to use the strength of her own experiences to help guide families that are faced with challenges related to aging and illness. Her devotion now is to assist others with personalized services to help them find just the right senior living community that meets their financial, psychological, social, and health care needs.  Outside of work she enjoys spending time with her beautiful granddaughters, my children and their families.  Pattie Smith partnered with Seniorly in 2018.",

That's where his wife, Lori, and him raised their two daughters, Kate and Alli, who are now students at Penn State University. Pennsylvania welcomed John's family and has become their home, and the decision to move there in 2002 has turned out to be one of the best decisions of their lives.Lori is a physical therapist, and she wakes up each day with a mission to help people, something that John had always admired. Motivated by Lori's mission, he decided to make a significant career change, leaving the corporate world to find a new career in services, one where he could help people, too. John turned to Oasis Senior Advisors, a company that helps seniors and their families match the right place with their specific needs and desires. Finding that right place is a complex and emotional process for families, and one that few families are prepared for.

They have raised three successful children, and now live on their own with their wonderful Chocolate Labrador Retriever named Bailey. Until they have grandchildren, she is the apple of their eye. They love to lie on the beach and read, garden, and run (with Bailey), and are active in their church.Rick has been an accountant throughout his career and Holly has had a variety of experiences, from being a telephone operator to teaching preschool. In the past seven years, they have had the opportunity to help both their parents find senior housing, unfortunately in dramatically different circumstances. Holly's mom became ill and had to make the transition to a temporary care facility. They were under a time crunch, and yet had to do all the research and all the visits. It would have been helpful to have someone who was plugged into the area to help them make an educated decision. Rick's parents had more time, but they moved to Florida. His sister assisted them, but did it primarily via the internet. That was so impersonal; they believe that the personal touch along with expertise in the area will ease your burden when making these types of tough decisions. That is why Holly and Rick joined Oasis. Their mission is to be a helping hand to those of you going through this difficult decision. They can help to lower the stress and give you an empathetic touch as you go through this stressful time. It would be their great honor to help you with your decision.
