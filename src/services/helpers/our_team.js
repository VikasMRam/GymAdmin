    description: `Arthur is a third generation senior housing operator. After selling his familyâ€™s senior housing company,
          he held two financial analyst roles in real estate and finance companies. He then founded a consulting firm, assisting 
          real estate developers and other financial institutions in entering the senior housing market. While pursuing his MBA
          at Berkeley-Haas, he created Seniorly to solve a problem he noticed while running his family's business. 
          Arthur is a native San Franciscan, and when he isn't working he is usually at Crissy Field with his wife, 
          two boys and Jack Russell terrier.
