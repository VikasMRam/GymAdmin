            , the properties and amenities have improved immensely over the years
            and so they are now called  senior living or assisted living communities.  These properties offer seniors
            room and board, 24-hour non-medical care, housekeeping, laundry services, social engagement,
            wellness programs, and much more. Assisted living communities can be large hotel-like properties

            Often, the decision to move into assisted living communities is made by the family or loved ones of

            Many consumer advocacy groups like AARP share statistics that 90% of people want to stay in their own homes
            as they age. While that is a reality for many seniors, the aging process is different for everyone. As
            people experience increased daily care needs, cognitive decline, social isolation, and/or the desire for a
            maintenance free lifestyle, assisted living communities can be the most desirable option.

          <Paragraph>
            Assisted Living can be the right  balance for seniors who want to be  independent, but also need some

          <Paragraph>
            Your loved one will still maintain the all-important feelings of freedom, minus the challenges that can

            comfortable living spaces, and prepared meals. Some communities that focus on higher acuity care may

            and Nursing Homes, though many use them interchangeably.  According to the CDC, over{' '}

          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            In contrast, most Assisted Living residents maintain active lifestyles needing only basic daily services
            such as bathing, mobility assistance, on-site medical care, etc. Allowing seniors to lead active,
            independent lives while also aiming to make daily life simpler and safer is the primary goal
            of Assisted Living communities.

            Seniors choosing to live in Independent Living vs. Assisted Living typically require very
            little, if any, daily assistance. Unlike Assisted Living, residents of these communities
            can get around, cook, bathe, clean, and manage the majority of their life without extra care.
            This provides the largest amount of independence. Hence, the name.

            Independent Living also provides the largest amount of day-to-day social activities, offers on-site
            medical services, and provides a safe, secure community. Living spaces are usually larger,
            apartment-style quarters with full kitchens, outdoor areas, private rooms, etc.

          <Paragraph>
            Unlike Assisted Living, services Independent Living often won’t provide include bathing, memory care,
            mobility services, on-going medical treatments, and more. Though Assisted Living communities will
            organize many social and enrichment activities, they are often more structured than activities in
            Independent Living.

            If your loved one currently lives a very self-reliant lifestyle with few medical needs, and is

            For those striving for a large degree of independence, but with some daily assistance, Assisted Living
            might be the ticket.
