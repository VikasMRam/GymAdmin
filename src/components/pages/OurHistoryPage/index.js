The senior living industry has grown rapidly giving consumers the ability to move into new homes that match their unique wants and needs to enable them to thrive. Despite this positive new reality, finding the right senior living options is a process that is often difficult, confusing, and frustrating. So, Arthur took on the challenge to solve this problem.
