     he held two financial analyst roles in real estate and finance companies. He then founded a consulting firm, assisting 
     real estate developers and other financial institutions in entering the senior housing market. While pursuing his MBA
      at Berkeley-Haas, he created Seniorly to solve a problem he noticed while running his family's business. 
      Arthur is a native San Franciscan, and when he isn't working he is usually at Crissy Field with his wife,
